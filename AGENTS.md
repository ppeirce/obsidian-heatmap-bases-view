# Obsidian community plugin

## Project overview

- Target: Obsidian Community Plugin (TypeScript → bundled JavaScript).
- Entry point: `main.ts` compiled to `main.js` and loaded by Obsidian.
- Required release artifacts: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and optional `styles.css`.

## Environment & tooling

- Node.js: use current LTS (Node 18+ recommended).
- **Package manager: npm** (required for this sample - `package.json` defines npm scripts and dependencies).
- **Bundler: esbuild** (required for this sample - `esbuild.config.mjs` and build scripts depend on it). Alternative bundlers like Rollup or webpack are acceptable for other projects if they bundle all external dependencies into `main.js`.
- Types: `obsidian` type definitions.

**Note**: This sample project has specific technical dependencies on npm and esbuild. If you're creating a plugin from scratch, you can choose different tools, but you'll need to replace the build configuration accordingly.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Dev (watch)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Linting

- To use eslint install eslint from terminal: `npm install -g eslint`
- To use eslint to analyze this project use this command: `eslint main.ts`
- eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
- If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder: `eslint ./src/`

## File & folder conventions

- **Organize code into multiple files**: Split functionality across separate modules rather than putting everything in `main.ts`.
- Source lives in `src/`. Keep `main.ts` small and focused on plugin lifecycle (loading, unloading, registering commands).
- **Example file structure**:
  ```
  src/
    main.ts           # Plugin entry point, lifecycle management
    settings.ts       # Settings interface and defaults
    commands/         # Command implementations
      command1.ts
      command2.ts
    ui/              # UI components, modals, views
      modal.ts
      view.ts
    utils/           # Utility functions, helpers
      helpers.ts
      constants.ts
    types.ts         # TypeScript interfaces and types
  ```
- **Do not commit build artifacts**: Never commit `node_modules/`, `main.js`, or other generated files to version control.
- Keep the plugin small. Avoid large dependencies. Prefer browser-compatible packages.
- Generated output should be placed at the plugin root or `dist/` depending on your build setup. Release artifacts must end up at the top level of the plugin folder in the vault (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`).

## Manifest rules (`manifest.json`)

- Must include (non-exhaustive):  
  - `id` (plugin ID; for local dev it should match the folder name)  
  - `name`  
  - `version` (Semantic Versioning `x.y.z`)  
  - `minAppVersion`  
  - `description`  
  - `isDesktopOnly` (boolean)  
  - Optional: `author`, `authorUrl`, `fundingUrl` (string or map)
- Never change `id` after release. Treat it as stable API.
- Keep `minAppVersion` accurate when using newer APIs.
- Canonical requirements are coded here: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/.github/workflows/validate-plugin-entry.yml

## README maintenance

After adding new features, removing deprecated old features, fixing known bugs, etc., update the README.md to reflect the new state of the plugin.

## Testing

- Manual install for testing: copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` (if any) to:
  ```
  <Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/
  ```
- Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Commands & settings

- Any user-facing commands should be added via `this.addCommand(...)`.
- If the plugin has configuration, provide a settings tab and sensible defaults.
- Persist settings using `this.loadData()` / `this.saveData()`.
- Use stable command IDs; avoid renaming once released.

## Versioning & releases

- Bump `version` in `manifest.json` (SemVer) and update `versions.json` to map plugin version → minimum app version.
- Create a GitHub release whose tag exactly matches `manifest.json`'s `version`. Do not use a leading `v`.
- Attach `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` (if present) to the release as individual assets.
- After the initial release, follow the process to add/update your plugin in the community catalog as required.

## Security, privacy, and compliance

Follow Obsidian's **Developer Policies** and **Plugin Guidelines**. In particular:

- Default to local/offline operation. Only make network requests when essential to the feature.
- No hidden telemetry. If you collect optional analytics or call third-party services, require explicit opt-in and document clearly in `README.md` and in settings.
- Never execute remote code, fetch and eval scripts, or auto-update plugin code outside of normal releases.
- Minimize scope: read/write only what's necessary inside the vault. Do not access files outside the vault.
- Clearly disclose any external services used, data sent, and risks.
- Respect user privacy. Do not collect vault contents, filenames, or personal information unless absolutely necessary and explicitly consented.
- Avoid deceptive patterns, ads, or spammy notifications.
- Register and clean up all DOM, app, and interval listeners using the provided `register*` helpers so the plugin unloads safely.

## UX & copy guidelines (for UI text, commands, settings)

- Prefer sentence case for headings, buttons, and titles.
- Use clear, action-oriented imperatives in step-by-step copy.
- Use **bold** to indicate literal UI labels. Prefer "select" for interactions.
- Use arrow notation for navigation: **Settings → Community plugins**.
- Keep in-app strings short, consistent, and free of jargon.

## Performance

- Keep startup light. Defer heavy work until needed.
- Avoid long-running tasks during `onload`; use lazy initialization.
- Batch disk access and avoid excessive vault scans.
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations in response to file system events.

## Coding conventions

- TypeScript with `"strict": true` preferred.
- **Keep `main.ts` minimal**: Focus only on plugin lifecycle (onload, onunload, addCommand calls). Delegate all feature logic to separate modules.
- **Split large files**: If any file exceeds ~200-300 lines, consider breaking it into smaller, focused modules.
- **Use clear module boundaries**: Each file should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Bundle everything into `main.js` (no unbundled runtime deps).
- Avoid Node/Electron APIs if you want mobile compatibility; set `isDesktopOnly` accordingly.
- Prefer `async/await` over promise chains; handle errors gracefully.

## Mobile

- Don't assume desktop-only behavior unless `isDesktopOnly` is `true`.

## Agent do/don't

**Do**
- Add commands with stable IDs (don't rename once released).
- Provide defaults and validation in settings.
- Write idempotent code paths so reload/unload doesn't leak listeners or intervals.
- Use `this.register*` helpers for everything that needs cleanup.

**Don't**
- Introduce network calls without an obvious user-facing reason and documentation.
- Ship features that require cloud services without clear disclosure and explicit opt-in.
- Store or transmit vault contents unless essential and consented.

## Common tasks

### Organize code across multiple files

**main.ts** (minimal, lifecycle only):
```ts
import { Plugin } from "obsidian";
import { MySettings, DEFAULT_SETTINGS } from "./settings";
import { registerCommands } from "./commands";

export default class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  settings: MySettings;

  async onload() {
    this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
    registerCommands(this);
  }
}
```

**settings.ts**:
```ts
export interface MySettings {
  enabled: boolean;
  apiKey: string;
}

export const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MySettings = {
  enabled: true,
  apiKey: "",
};
```

**commands/index.ts**:
```ts
import { Plugin } from "obsidian";
import { doSomething } from "./my-command";

export function registerCommands(plugin: Plugin) {
  plugin.addCommand({
    id: "do-something",
    name: "Do something",
    callback: () => doSomething(plugin),
  });
}
```

### Add a command

```ts
this.addCommand({
  id: "your-command-id",
  name: "Do the thing",
  callback: () => this.doTheThing(),
});
```

### Persist settings

```ts
interface MySettings { enabled: boolean }
const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MySettings = { enabled: true };

async onload() {
  this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
  await this.saveData(this.settings);
}
```

### Register listeners safely

```ts
this.registerEvent(this.app.workspace.on("file-open", f => { /* ... */ }));
this.registerDomEvent(window, "resize", () => { /* ... */ });
this.registerInterval(window.setInterval(() => { /* ... */ }, 1000));
```

## Troubleshooting

- Plugin doesn't load after build: ensure `main.js` and `manifest.json` are at the top level of the plugin folder under `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/`.
- Build issues: if `main.js` is missing, run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` to compile your TypeScript source code.
- Commands not appearing: verify `addCommand` runs after `onload` and IDs are unique.
- Settings not persisting: ensure `loadData`/`saveData` are awaited and you re-render the UI after changes.
- Mobile-only issues: confirm you're not using desktop-only APIs; check `isDesktopOnly` and adjust.

## BasesView implementation (CRITICAL)

When implementing a custom `BasesView`, you **MUST** follow this exact pattern. Deviating from it causes subtle bugs where the view fails to load when set as the default view.

### The correct pattern

```ts
export class MyBasesView extends BasesView {
  readonly type = 'my-view';  // Use readonly
  private containerEl: HTMLElement;

  constructor(controller: QueryController, parentEl: HTMLElement) {
    super(controller);
    // CRITICAL: Create a child div, do NOT use parentEl directly
    this.containerEl = parentEl.createDiv('my-view-container');
  }

  onDataUpdated(): void {
    this.render();
  }

  private render(): void {
    this.containerEl.empty();
    // ... render your view into this.containerEl
  }
}
```

### Critical requirements

1. **Create a child container**: In the constructor, call `parentEl.createDiv('class-name')` to create your own container element. Do NOT store `parentEl` directly as your container.

2. **Do NOT override `onload()`**: The base class `onload()` sets up the subscription to data updates. If you override it without calling `super.onload()`, `onDataUpdated()` will never be called when the view is the default view.

3. **Use `readonly type`**: Declare the type property as `readonly`.

4. **All rendering in `onDataUpdated()`**: This is the only lifecycle hook you need. It's called both for initial render and subsequent data changes.

### What goes wrong if you deviate

**Bug symptoms:**
- View works when switching to it from another view
- View fails to load (shows empty/0 results) when set as the default view
- UI freezes and you cannot switch views
- Console error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'views')`

**Root cause investigation showed:**
- When using `containerEl` directly (instead of creating a child div), the view fails silently when it's the default
- `onDataUpdated()` is never called in the default view case
- The Bases framework expects views to create their own child container

**Debugging output that revealed the issue:**
```
// When heatmap is the DEFAULT view (broken):
[HeatmapView] constructor called {hasController: true, hasContainerEl: true}
// onDataUpdated is NEVER called

// When switching TO heatmap (works):
[HeatmapView] constructor called {hasController: true, hasContainerEl: true}
[HeatmapView] onDataUpdated called {hasData: true, dataLength: 820, hasConfig: true}
```

### The fix

Changed from:
```ts
constructor(controller: QueryController, containerEl: HTMLElement) {
  super(controller);
  this.containerEl = containerEl;  // WRONG: using parent directly
}
```

To:
```ts
constructor(controller: QueryController, parentEl: HTMLElement) {
  super(controller);
  this.containerEl = parentEl.createDiv('heatmap-view-container');  // CORRECT: create child
}
```

This single change fixed the bug where the view wouldn't load as the default view.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
